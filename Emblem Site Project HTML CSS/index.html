                   <p>Emblem sells rare and collectable fiction and poetry. We are particularly interested in 18th and 19th
                century books, and have a world-renowned stock of latter 19th century women’s writing. Of particular

                restoration service, and consultancy on investment in rare books. We issue printed and illustrated
                catalogues of rare books twice a year. We also exhibit at book fairs in the UK, New Zealand, Canada and
                the USA.

                <h1>Valuing Books</h1>
                    <p>If you possess books you wish to sell then a formal valuation the most appropriate course of action.
                Emblem undertakes written valuations for insurance purposes or personal interest. We can appraise a
                single books or collections.
                If you wish to have a book valued, a free initial verbal assessment of whether the book is likely to
                have sufficient value to merit a full valuation is recommended. If you decide to go ahead with the
                valuation, Emblem will provide you with an estimate of the cost before the valuation is carried out in
                full. Fees for valuation work are charged at a half day rate of £300.
